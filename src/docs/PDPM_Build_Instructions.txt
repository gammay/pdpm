Build and Test Instructions
---------------------------

1. PDPM Collector
- Open the workspace PDPM_Collector.dsw in Visual C++ and build
- The other workspace PDPM_Collector_Console.dsw is for debugging, uses the same files, but this builds a project with console, so that you can use printfs for debugging.

To run PDPM Collector:
- Copy the file cfg-pdpm.pdp from PDPM Reporter folder to the PDPM Collector folder
- Run or debug the PDPM Collector exe from VC++ IDE

2. PDPM Reporter
- Open the file build.bat in an editor and configure JDK path (JAVAC_PATH)
- Open a command prompt and run build.bat, which creates pdpm.jar

To test Test_Logs:
- Create folders Logs and Reports under PDPM_Reporter
- Copy logs from Test_Logs to Logs folder
- Configure Set-Java-Path.bat to point to JRE (or JDK) java.exe location
- Open command prompt and run
Generate-Report.bat <log file name>
- Repeat for each log file

3. PDPM Installer:
- In folder PDPM_Installer open bld-info.pdp in editor and configure build version
- Double-click copy_files.bat to copy files required for installation into PDPM_Installer folder (PDPM Collector and Reporter should already be built)
- Right-click on pdpm_installer.nsi and select "Compile NSIS script"
- pdpm_setup.exe is produced which can be run to install PDPM
